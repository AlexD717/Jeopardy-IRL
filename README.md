# Jeopardy IRL

A custom Jeopardy website that also integrates with physical buttons. You connect one esp through serial to the device running the website, and the rest of the buttons connect to that esp through the ESP NOW protocol, allowing for wireless communication. This enables the Jeopardy website to know which button was pressed first, and give/subtract points from that team.
